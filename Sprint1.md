# Sprint 1

## User Stories

### User 1
As a University of Florida student living off-campus, I would like a service to rent, buy, and sell furniture from other, reliable students. The most basic feature I'd like to see from this service is the ability to make an account and log into it. In order to do so, there has to be a login screen that takes in username and password typed into it. I want to be able to click on the "log in" button that directs me to another page telling me that I was able to successfully log in to my account. Moreover, if I do not have an account, I want to see a "sign up" button that directs me to a sign up page where I am able to sign up with my own username and password.

### User 2
As a college student, I don't want to buy furniture as I plan to move around a lot. I want to rent furniture, safely, at a reasonable price. I want to know what I'm getting and who I'm renting my furniture from. 

### User 3
As a person who travels frequently for work, I don't live in an area for more than a couple years. I find it to be more expensive and tiring to move furniture, and I would rather not constantly buy and sell furniture. I would enjoy a platform that lets me rent from others and let me see the ratings and reviews of other users before renting.

## Issues Planned to Address
Some issues that we plan to addres are:

1. Create a login screen with user authentication
2. Create a dashboard that allows users to list furniture for sale or rent, and a tab to take the user to the furniture marketplaces to browse.
3. A way to allow users to upload pictures

## Issues Successfully Completed
Some issues that we have successfully completed:

1. Created a way to store user information
2. Added password encryption to protect user passwords
3. Created APIs for users and posts/listings
4. Created a login screen and a sign up page

## Issues Not Successfully Completed
1. User authentication is not completed yet - it took a while to settle down with a specific details of the frontend and didn't have enough time to set up the authentication method.
2. Dashboard - this was divided into multiple pages to create (front page, homepage, selling board, renting board, posting page) and will be addressed separately in the upcoming sprints.
