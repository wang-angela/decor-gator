## User Stories

### User 1
As a University of Florida student living off-campus, I would like a service to rent, buy, and sell furniture from other, reliable students. 
The most basic feature I'd like to see from this service is the ability to make an account and log into it.

### User 2
In order to do so, there has to be a login screen that takes in username and password typed into it. I want to be able to click on the "log in" button that directs me to another page telling me that I was able to successfully log in to my account. Moreover, if I do not have an account, I want to see a "sign up" button that directs me to a sign up page where I am able to sign up with my own username and password.
