## Requirements for running/using the application:

First, clone the respository. For starting the individual backend/frontend:

### Backend:

In order to run this program, you must have GO installed. There is a backend.exe file in the /backend folder. Before running the application, run this executable in a terminal using the command `./backend.exe` within the backend directory of the project to start the server locally.

### Frontend:

The app's frontend was built using TypeScript and React; these must both be installed alongside Node. To run the app's frontend, first navigate to the /decor-gator-frontend folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies. Then, using `npm start` will start the frontend portion of the application.
